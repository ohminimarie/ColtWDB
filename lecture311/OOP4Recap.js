//Recap

//OOP is a model based on objects constructed from a blueprint. We use
//OOP to write more modular and shareable code

//In languages that have built-in support for OOP, we call these 
//blueprints "classes" and the objects created from them "instances"

//Since we do not have built-in class support in Javascript, we mimic
//classes by using fnctions. These constructor functions create objects
//through the use of the new keyword


//We can avoide duplication in multiple constructor funtions by using call 
//or apply
