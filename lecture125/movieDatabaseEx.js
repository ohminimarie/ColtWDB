//Create an array of movie objects. Each movie should have a title, 
//rating and hasWatched properties. Iterate through the array and
//print out something that looks like:

// You have watched "In Bruges" - 5 stars
// You have not seen "Frozen" - 4.5 stars
// You have seen "Mad Max Fury Road" - 5 stars
// You have not seen "Les Miserables" - 3.5 stars

// Use your own movies!!
